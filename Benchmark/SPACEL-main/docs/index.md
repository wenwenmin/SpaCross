SPACEL (**SP**atial **A**rchitecture **C**haracterization by d**E**ep **L**earning) is a Python package of deep-learning-based methods for ST data analysis. SPACEL consists of three modules: 

- Spoint embedded a multiple-layer perceptron with a probabilistic model to deconvolute cell type composition for each spot on single ST slice.
- Splane employs a graph convolutional network approach and an adversarial learning algorithm to identify uniform spatial domains that are transcriptomically and spatially coherent across multiple ST slices.
- Scube automatically transforms the spatial coordinate systems of consecutive slices and stacks them together to construct a three-dimensional (3D) alignment of the tissue.
